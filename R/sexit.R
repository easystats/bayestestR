#' Sequential Effect eXistence and sIgnificance Testing (SEXIT)
#'
#' The SEXIT is a new framework to describe Bayesian effects, guiding which
#' indices to use. Accordingly, the `sexit()` function returns the minimal (and
#' optimal) required information to describe models' parameters under a Bayesian
#' framework. It includes the following indices:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{Centrality: the median of the posterior distribution. In
#'   probabilistic terms, there is `50%` of probability that the effect is higher
#'   and lower. See [`point_estimate()`][point_estimate].}
#'   \item{Uncertainty: the `95%` Highest Density Interval (HDI). In
#'   probabilistic terms, there is `95%` of probability that the effect is
#'   within this confidence interval. See [`ci()`][ci].}
#'   \item{Existence: The probability of direction allows to quantify the
#'   certainty by which an effect is positive or negative. It is a critical
#'   index to show that an effect of some manipulation is not harmful (for
#'   instance in clinical studies) or to assess the direction of a link. See
#'   [`p_direction()`][p_direction].}
#'   \item{Significance: Once existence is demonstrated with high certainty, we
#'   can assess whether the effect is of sufficient size to be considered as
#'   significant (i.e., not negligible). This is a useful index to determine
#'   which effects are actually important and worthy of discussion in a given
#'   process. See [`p_significance()`][p_significance].}
#'   \item{Size: Finally, this index gives an idea about the strength of an
#'   effect. However, beware, as studies have shown that a big effect size can
#'   be also suggestive of low statistical power (see details section).}

#' \subsection{Rationale}{
#' The assessment of "significance" (in its broadest meaning) is a pervasive
#' issue in science, and its historical index, the p-value, has been strongly
#' criticized and deemed to have played an important role in the replicability
#' crisis. In reaction, more and more scientists have tuned to Bayesian methods,
#' offering an alternative set of tools to answer their questions. However, the
#' Bayesian framework offers a wide variety of possible indices related to
#' "significance", and the debate has been raging about which index is the best,
#' and which one to report.
#'
#' This situation can lead to the mindless reporting of all possible indices
#' (with the hopes that with that the reader will be satisfied), but often
#' without having the writer understanding and interpreting them. It is indeed
#' complicated to juggle between many indices with complicated definitions and
#' subtle differences.
#'
#' SEXIT aims at offering a practical framework for Bayesian effects reporting,
#' in which the focus is put on intuitiveness, explicitness and usefulness of
#' the indices' interpretation. To that end, we suggest a system of description
#' of parameters that would be intuitive, easy to learn and apply,
#' mathematically accurate and useful for taking decision.
#'
#' Once the thresholds for significance (i.e., the ROPE) and the one for a
#' "large" effect are explicitly defined, the SEXIT framework does not make any
#' interpretation, i.e., it does not label the effects, but just sequentially
#' gives 3 probabilities (of direction, of significance and of being large,
#' respectively) as-is on top of the characteristics of the posterior (using the
#' median and HDI for centrality and uncertainty description). Thus, it provides
#' a lot of information about the posterior distribution (through the mass of
#' different 'sections' of the posterior) in a clear and meaningful way.
#' }
#'
#' \subsection{Threshold selection}{
#'  One of the most important thing about the SEXIT framework is that it relies
#'  on two "arbitrary" thresholds (i.e., that have no absolute meaning). They
#'  are the ones related to effect size (an inherently subjective notion),
#'  namely the thresholds for significant and large effects. They are set, by
#'  default, to `0.05` and `0.3` of the standard deviation of the outcome
#'  variable (tiny and large effect sizes for correlations according to Funder
#'  and Ozer, 2019). However, these defaults were chosen by lack of a better
#'  option, and might not be adapted to your case. Thus, they are to be handled
#'  with care, and the chosen thresholds should always be explicitly reported
#'  and justified.
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item For **linear models (lm)**, this can be generalised to \ifelse{html}{\out{0.05 * SD<sub>y</sub>}}{\eqn{[0.05*SD_{y}]}} and \ifelse{html}{\out{0.3 * SD<sub>y</sub>}}{\eqn{[0.3*SD_{y}]}} for significant and large effects, respectively.
#'     \item For **logistic models**, the parameters expressed in log odds ratio can be converted to standardized difference through the formula \ifelse{html}{\out{&pi;/&radic;(3)}}{\eqn{\pi/\sqrt{3}}}, resulting a threshold of `0.09` and `0.54`.
#'     \item For other models with **binary outcome**, it is strongly recommended to manually specify the rope argument. Currently, the same default is applied that for logistic models.
#'     \item For models from **count data**, the residual variance is used. This is a rather experimental threshold and is probably often similar to `0.05` and `0.3`, but should be used with care!
#'     \item For **t-tests**, the standard deviation of the response is used, similarly to linear models (see above).
#'     \item For **correlations**,`0.05` and `0.3` are used.
#'     \item For all other models, `0.05` and `0.3` are used, but it is strongly advised to specify it manually.
#'   }
#' }
#' \subsection{Examples}{
#' The three values for existence, significance and size provide a useful description of the posterior distribution of the effects. Some possible scenarios include:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{The probability of existence is low, but the probability of being large is high: it suggests that the posterior is very wide (covering large territories on both side of 0). The statistical power might be too low, which should warrant any confident conclusion.}
#'   \item{The probability of existence and significance is high, but the probability of being large is very small: it suggests that the effect is, with high confidence, not large (the posterior is mostly contained between the significance and the large thresholds).}
#'   \item{The 3 indices are very low: this suggests that the effect is null with high confidence (the posterior is closely centred around 0).}}}
