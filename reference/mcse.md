# Monte-Carlo Standard Error (MCSE)

This function returns the Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE).

## Usage

``` r
mcse(model, ...)

# S3 method for class 'stanreg'
mcse(model, effects = "fixed", component = "location", parameters = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments

- model:

  A `stanreg`, `stanfit`, `brmsfit`, `blavaan`, or `MCMCglmm` object.

- ...:

  Currently not used.

- effects:

  Should variables for fixed effects (`"fixed"`), random effects
  (`"random"`) or both (`"all"`) be returned? Only applies to mixed
  models. May be abbreviated.

  For models of from packages **brms** or **rstanarm** there are
  additional options:

  - `"fixed"` returns fixed effects.

  - `"random_variance"` return random effects parameters (variance and
    correlation components, e.g. those parameters that start with `sd_`
    or `cor_`).

  - `"grouplevel"` returns random effects group level estimates, i.e.
    those parameters that start with `r_`.

  - `"random"` returns both `"random_variance"` and `"grouplevel"`.

  - `"all"` returns fixed effects and random effects variances.

  - `"full"` returns all parameters.

- component:

  Which type of parameters to return, such as parameters for the
  conditional model, the zero-inflated part of the model, the dispersion
  term, etc. See details in section *Model Components*. May be
  abbreviated. Note that the *conditional* component also refers to the
  *count* or *mean* component - names may differ, depending on the
  modeling package. There are three convenient shortcuts (not applicable
  to *all* model classes):

  - `component = "all"` returns all possible parameters.

  - If `component = "location"`, location parameters such as
    `conditional`, `zero_inflated`, `smooth_terms`, or `instruments` are
    returned (everything that are fixed or random effects - depending on
    the `effects` argument - but no auxiliary parameters).

  - For `component = "distributional"` (or `"auxiliary"`), components
    like `sigma`, `dispersion`, `beta` or `precision` (and other
    auxiliary parameters) are returned.

- parameters:

  Regular expression pattern that describes the parameters that should
  be returned. Meta-parameters (like `lp__` or `prior_`) are filtered by
  default, so only parameters that typically appear in the
  [`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) are returned. Use
  `parameters` to select specific parameters for the output.

## Details

**Monte Carlo Standard Error (MCSE)** is another measure of accuracy of
the chains. It is defined as standard deviation of the chains divided by
their effective sample size (the formula for `mcse()` is from Kruschke
2015, p. 187). The MCSE “provides a quantitative suggestion of how big
the estimation noise is”.

## Model components

Possible values for the `component` argument depend on the model class.
Following are valid options:

- `"all"`: returns all model components, applies to all models, but will
  only have an effect for models with more than just the conditional
  model component.

- `"conditional"`: only returns the conditional component, i.e. "fixed
  effects" terms from the model. Will only have an effect for models
  with more than just the conditional model component.

- `"smooth_terms"`: returns smooth terms, only applies to GAMs (or
  similar models that may contain smooth terms).

- `"zero_inflated"` (or `"zi"`): returns the zero-inflation component.

- `"location"`: returns location parameters such as `conditional`,
  `zero_inflated`, or `smooth_terms` (everything that are fixed or
  random effects - depending on the `effects` argument - but no
  auxiliary parameters).

- `"distributional"` (or `"auxiliary"`): components like `sigma`,
  `dispersion`, `beta` or `precision` (and other auxiliary parameters)
  are returned.

For models of class `brmsfit` (package **brms**), even more options are
possible for the `component` argument, which are not all documented in
detail here. See also
