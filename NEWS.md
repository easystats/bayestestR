# bayestestR 0.12.x

## Breaking

* The minimum needed R version has been bumped to `3.6`.

* `contr.equalprior(contrasts = FALSE)` (previously `contr.orthonorm`) no longer returns an identity matrix, but a shifted `diag(n) - 1/n`, for consistency.

## New functionality

* `p_to_bf()`, to convert p-values into Bayes factors. For more accurate approximate Bayes factors, use `bic_to_bf()`.
* *bayestestR* now supports objects of class `rvar` from package *posterior*.
* `contr.equalprior` (previously `contr.orthonorm`) gains two new functions: `contr.equalprior_pairs` and `contr.equalprior_deviations` to aide in setting more intuitive priors.

## Changes

*  has been renamed *`contr.equalprior`* to be more explicit about its function.
* `p_direction()` now accepts objects of class `parameters_model()` (from
  `parameters::model_parameters()`), to compute probability of direction for
  parameters of frequentist models.


# bayestestR 0.12.1

## Breaking

* `Bayesfactor_models()` for frequentist models now relies on the updated `insight::get_loglikelihood()`. This might change some results for REML based models. See documentation.

* `estimate_density()` argument `group_by` is renamed `at`.

* All `distribution_*(random = FALSE)` functions now rely on `ppoints()`, which will result in slightly different results, especially with small `n`s.

* Uncertainty estimation now defaults to `"eti"` (formerly was `"hdi"`).

## Changes

* *bayestestR* functions now support `draws` objects from package *posterior*.

* `rope_range()` now handles log(normal)-families and models with log-transformed outcomes.

* New function `spi()`, to compute shortest probability intervals. Furthermore, the `"spi"` option was added as new method to compute uncertainty intervals.

## Bug fixes

* `bci()` for some objects incorrectly returned the equal-tailed intervals.

# bayestestR 0.11.5

* Fixes failing tests in CRAN checks.

# bayestestR 0.11.1

## New functions

* `describe_posterior()` gains a `plot()` method, which is a short cut for
  `plot(estimate_density(describe_posterior()))`.

# bayestestR 0.11

## Bug fixes

* Fixed issues related to last *brms* update.

* Fixed bug in `describe_posterior.BFBayesFactor()` where Bayes factors were missing from out put ( #442 ).

# bayestestR 0.10.0

## Breaking

* All Bayes factors are now returned as `log(BF)` (column name `log_BF`).
  Printing is unaffected. To retrieve the raw BFs, you can run `exp(result$log_BF)`.

## New functions

* `bci()` (and its alias `bcai()`) to compute bias-corrected and accelerated
  bootstrap intervals. Along with this new function, `ci()` and
  `describe_posterior()` gain a new `ci_method` type, `"bci"`.

## Changes

* `contr.bayes` has been renamed *`contr.orthonorm`* to be more explicit about its function.

# bayestestR 0.9.0

## Breaking

* The default `ci` width has been changed to 0.95 instead of 0.89 (see
  [here](https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR/discussions/250)). This should
  not come as a surprise to the long-time users of `bayestestR` as we have been
  warning about this impending change for a while now :)

* Column names for `bayesfactor_restricted()` are now `p_prior` and
  `p_posterior` (was `Prior_prob` and `Posterior_prob`), to be consistent with
  `bayesfactor_inclusion()` output.

* Removed the experimental function `mhdior`.

## General

* Support for `blavaan` models.

* Support for `blrm` models (*rmsb*).

* Support for `BGGM` models (*BGGM*).

* `check_prior()` and `describe_prior()` should now also work for more ways of
  prior definition in models from *rstanarm* or *brms*.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed bug in `print()` method for the `mediation()` function.

* Fixed remaining inconsistencies with CI values, which were not reported as
  fraction for `rope()`.

* Fixed issues with special prior definitions in `check_prior()`,
  `describe_prior()` and `simulate_prior()`.

## General

* Support for `bamlss` models.

* Roll-back R dependency to R >= 3.4.

## Changes to functions

* All `.stanreg` methods gain a `component` argument, to also include auxiliary
  parameters.

## Bug fixes

* `bayesfactor_parameters()` no longer errors for no reason when computing
  extremely un/likely direction hypotheses.

* `bayesfactor_pointull()` / `bf_pointull()` are now `bayesfactor_pointnull()` /
  `bf_pointnull()` (can *you* spot the difference? #363 ).

# bayestestR 0.8.0

## New functions

  (SEXIT).

## General

* Added startup-message to warn users that default ci-width might change in a
  future update.

* Added support for *mcmc.list* objects.

## Bug fixes

* `unupdate()` gains a `newdata` argument to work with `brmsfit_multiple`
  models.

  not available).

# bayestestR 0.7.5

## New functions

* Added `as.matrix()` function for `bayesfactor_model` arrays.

* `unupdate()`, a utility function to get Bayesian models un-fitted from the
  data, representing the priors only.

## Changes to functions

* `ci()` supports `emmeans` - both Bayesian and frequentist ( #312 - cross fix
  with `parameters`)

## Bug fixes

* Fixed issue with *default* rope range for `BayesFactor` models.

* Fixed issue in collinearity-check for `rope()` for models with less than two
  parameters.

* Fixed issue in print-method for `mediation()` with `stanmvreg`-models, which
  displays the wrong name for the response-value.

* Fixed issue in `effective_sample()` for models with only one parameter.

* `rope_range()` for `BayesFactor` models returns non-`NA` values ( #343 )
