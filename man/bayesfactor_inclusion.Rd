\title{Inclusion Bayes Factors for testing predictors across Bayesian models}
\usage{
bayesfactor_inclusion(models, match_models = FALSE, prior_odds = NULL, ...)

bf_inclusion(models, match_models = FALSE, prior_odds = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{An object of class \code{\link[=bayesfactor_models]{bayesfactor_models()}} or \code{BFBayesFactor}.}

\item{match_models}{See details.}

\item{prior_odds}{Optional vector of prior odds for the models. See
\verb{BayesFactor::priorOdds<-}.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
a data frame containing the prior and posterior probabilities, and
log(BF) for each effect (Use \code{as.numeric()} to extract the non-log Bayes
factors; see examples).
}
\description{
The \verb{bf_*} function is an alias of the main function.

\details{
Inclusion Bayes factors answer the question: Are the observed data
more probable under models with a particular effect, than they are under
models without that particular effect? In other words, on average - are
models with effect \eqn{X} more likely to have produced the observed data
than models without effect \eqn{X}?

\subsection{Match Models}{
If \code{match_models=FALSE} (default), Inclusion BFs are computed by comparing
all models with a term against all models without that term. If \code{TRUE},
comparison is restricted to models that (1) do not include any interactions
with the term of interest; (2) for interaction terms, averaging is done only
across models that containe the main effect terms from which the interaction
term is comprised.
}
}
\note{
Random effects in the \code{lmer} style are converted to interaction terms:
i.e., \code{(X|G)} will become the terms \code{1:G} and \code{X:G}.

\section{Interpreting Bayes Factors}{

A Bayes factor greater than 1 can be interpreted as evidence against the
null, at which one convention is that a Bayes factor greater than 3 can be
considered as "substantial" evidence against the null (and vice versa, a
Bayes factor smaller than 1/3 indicates substantial evidence in favor of the
null-model) (\cite{Wetzels et al. 2011}).
